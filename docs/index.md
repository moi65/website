For example:
A customer who has previously added devices or scenes to their device cloud says, “Alexa, turn on the kitchen light” to their Amazon Echo or other Alexa-enabled device.
The Amazon Echo or other Alexa-enabled device hears this instruction and sends it to the Alexa service for interpretation.
The Alexa Smart Home Skill API interprets the action as "turn on" and the device name as "kitchen light". It composes a message to send to the skill adapter that controls the kitchen light. This message is called a directive. 
The directive includes:
The action (turn on)
The device identifier (an ID representing the device that the customer named "kitchen light")
Information authenticating the customer
The skill adapter receives and parses the request for the action, the device identifier and authentication details. It uses this information to communicate with the device cloud. The skill adapter generates a message to the customer's device cloud, and tells the kitchen light to turn on.
The device cloud gets the message and the kitchen light turns on.
The skill adapter sends a response back to the Smart Home Skill API indicating whether it was successful. Alexa uses this response to determine the appropriate response to the customer. For example, Alexa might say, “OK” to indicate the requested is complete. (not shown in diagram)
